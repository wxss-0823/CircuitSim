Momentum MomEngine_64 2020.00.283 (*) built: Jul 17 2019
Copyright  1992 - 2019 Keysight Technologies
Simulation started on: Mon Nov 27 16:49:16 2023
Simulation Mode: uW
Substrate valid
Automatically determined a snap distance of
0.0021 mil for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.0001 mil.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.
